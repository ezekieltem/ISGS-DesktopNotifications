Directly Through PowerShell, etc:

1: Install node.js
 1.1: If you already have it skip this step.

2: Open "Windows PowerShell"
 2.1: If you are on other operating systems open the respective application to this.

3: run "Set-Location <PATH>"
-3.1: replace "<PATH>" with the directory to the folder this .txt is located in
-3.2 If this directory path has any spaces in it, for example `C:\Users\ezeki\Desktop\Visual Studio Code` the points that have spaces surround them in "", so in this case 
-----`C:\Users\ezeki\Desktop\Visual Studio Code` would become `C:\Users\ezeki\Desktop\"Visual Studio Code"`, etc

4: run "node index.js"

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Through a Shortcut/exe:

1: Install node.js
 1.1: If you already have it skip this step.

2: Create a file in the same directory as this .txt, name it whatever you want but make sure it ends with ".ps1"
-2.1: Set the files contents to:
Set-Location <PATH>
node index.js
-2.2: replace "<PATH>" with the directory to the folder this .txt is located in
-2.3 If this directory path has any spaces in it, for example `C:\Users\ezeki\Desktop\Visual Studio Code` the points that have spaces surround them in "", so in this case 
-----`C:\Users\ezeki\Desktop\Visual Studio Code` would become `C:\Users\ezeki\Desktop\"Visual Studio Code"`, etc
3: Run "Windows PowerShell" as Administrator.
-3.1: Run "Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted"
-3.2: Run "Install-Module ps2exe"
-3.3: Finally Run "Invoke-ps2exe <PATH_TO_.ps1> <PATH_TO_WHERE_YOU_WANT_THE_EXE>"
-3.4: replace "<PATH_TO_.ps1> with the location of the ".ps1" file you created in step 2
-3.5: replace <PATH_TO_WHERE_YOU_WANT_THE_EXE> to the directory of where the ".exe" file will be found. Besure to include "/<NAME_HERE>.exe". (I would recommend the same directory as the ".ps1")
----- Example: `Invoke-ps2exe C:\Users\ezeki\Desktop\"ISGS Desktop Notifications"\PowerShellCommand.ps1 C:\Users\ezeki\Desktop\"ISGS Desktop Notifications"\ISGSDesktop.exe`
